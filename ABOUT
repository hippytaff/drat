What Drat Is

Drat is a GNU/Linux distrobution which is basically ubuntu with ratpoison tiling window manager and Terminology tweaked 
and configured into a functional destop environment that was designed as a personal solution for a specific set of 
circumstances and restrictions. The main one was only having access to a borrowed laptop, off which the only way to use 
linux was via usb. After using a live enbironment for a good few months, setting up your desktop as you like it, with 
all the rc files and things you want to install gets ever so tiresome. Persistent usb's corrupt (for me at least) 
within days and the option to install proper to usb wasn't an option, with only one usb to run linux on and only 
windows to use to install an linux on usb, which was never going to happen. Even if there is a way, there isn't. Drat 
is my already configured and set up live usb what how I like it. If you like it too splendid. :)


What Drat Isn't 

Drat isn't anything other than a personal solution to a...it say's up there ^ When I mentioned this to people in irc 
and around and about their reactions were always, just get a cheap laptop, just get a bouple of cheap usb sticks etc. 
And while this is an obvious solution, and one I am usually not too stoned to work out for myself, this was not an 
option either. Things were tough. Fun, but tough...So this about feels like more of a justification than an about even 
though I've made this thing for myself.


What's in Drat

Ubuntu base, Ratpoisonwm, Terminology terminal emulator (default), Midnight Commander, irssi, firefox, tty-clock, tree 
and some other cli stuff.


Why is it called Drat?

Following the ratpoison theme of killing the rodent (mouse), which is explained a lot more elquently
here - http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/inspiration.html
The name was going to be deadrat, which as with anything GNU/linux, quickly got shortenend to drat, and drat was easier to type.
